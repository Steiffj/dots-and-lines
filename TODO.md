- Generate lots of test data.
- Make node hover renderers responsive to light/dark mode.
- Render self loops.
- Efficient node/edge reducers - object pooling with garbage collection management through graphology event emitters.
    - support multiple callbacks with priority and graph/renderer variable access.
- Event performance optimizations (turn off node/edge events while panning?)
- Manage dragging state in graph attributes.
- Keyboard navigation.
- Create new nodes and edges interactively.
    - Use a lil baby invisible node to support connecting new edge to target.
- Monaco editor integration.
- Read/edit data from filesystem.
    - Edit graph datasets with live reload.
    - Save screenshot of the graph visualization with the serialized graph data.
- Utilize WebGL layer for grouping?
- Minimap?
- Resizable split window
- Tab selection when stage is focused based on mouse position.
    - Navigate via tab/shift-tab
    - Esc to leave stage focus
- Render HTML overlay/popup elements on top of stage - auto constrain to viewport.
- Bottom status bar.
- Icon registry (Python API with server-side image/SVG resizing via query params)
- Layout options
    - Fix subgraphs in place
    - Only allow specified nodes to move
- Write ForceAtlas2 layout preprocessor algorithm for nicer animation and fast convergence.
- Color themes plus some generation
    - Colorblind options.
